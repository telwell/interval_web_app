# Interval Code Challenge

The idea here was to build a system to collect data on an interval and save it to a DB, recording time and value. Then, build a graphical display of the collected data above a table displaying said data. 

# My Solution

My solution was written in PHP with the following libraries: 

* 	[Guzzle 6](http://guzzle.readthedocs.org/en/latest/): Guzzle is a PHP HTTP client that makes it easy to send HTTP requests and trivial to integrate with web services.

*	[Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/): Simple, clean and engaging charts for designers and developers.

These helped immensely but the heavy lifting was done via the code. I've tried to include comments throughout so that it reads clearly. Please leave any questions in the comments below!

# Todos: 

Presently, the most prominent todo for this project would be to add pagination to the table below the chart (because eventually it will become unwieldy).
